### Why decided to join MWS?

Letâ€™s have a look on why the members decided to join MWS.

#### Deyeera A/p S Ponambalam

> I joined MSW because I want to expand my knowledge on the Microsoft applications and at the same time, I want to share those knowledge and tips I've learnt with others.

#### Nicole Lian Kim Kim

> I joined MWS so that I can learn more about the software and teach my fellow peers from design backgrounds on how to utilize and combine Microsoft Office 365 with their knowledge on Adobe software.

#### Riann Ang Han Ying

> The reason for joining the MWS is because I am passionate about learning and exploring to be a better me. Besides, I have joined a few sharing sessions that were conducted by MWS, I am so impressed by the presentation skill and Microsoft technique that the members had brought to us. I wish that I could enhance my Microsoft skills and have better personal development as well as share the importance of Microsoft applications to the public by joining the MWS family!

#### Whitney Hum Wei Sin

> I saw MWS as an opportunity for me to gain new skills and more exposure. Basically, it seems like a great way to discipline myself with more responsibilities that benefit me and others.

#### May Lee Mei Mei

> I want to step out of my comfort zone and I believe that it can provide me the opportunity to improve myself and develop skills such as leadership and communication skills.

#### Joanne Loo Si Ann

#### Liew Ya Shuen

#### Michelle Yee Khai Le

> Hello I am Michelle, a final year student majoring in Accounting and Finance in collaboration with University of Hertfordshire. What intrigued me to be a Microsoft Workplace Squadâ€™s Student Ambassador was how we as students are given the opportunity to take on interesting roles that can greatly build our character as well our soft skills through the planning of events as well as when educating the students and lecturers on ways to navigate Microsoft Office 365. I believe that by becoming a Microsoft Student Ambassador, I can thrive greatly.
