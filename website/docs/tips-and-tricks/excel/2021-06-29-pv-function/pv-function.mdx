**Present Value** or also known as PV function is a function in Excel that can help you to calculate the current worth of a future sum of money or stream of cash flow with a given specified rate of return.

Specifically, the current worth of a future sum of money or stream of cash flows given a specified rate of return. It is calculated by discounting the future sum of money by the specified rate of return, taking into account the time value of money.

Formula: `=PV(rate, nper, pmt, [fv], [type])`
